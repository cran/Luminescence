NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.6.2 (1st September 2016):

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_IRSAR.RF()’

             • Test parameter ‘curves_bounds’ was not calculated
               correctly; fixed,

             • first output object renamed to ‘data’, instead of
               ‘De.values’.

         • ‘analyse_SAR.CWOSL()’

             • The first object in the returned ‘RLum.Results’ objects
               was renamed to ‘data’ to gain consistency with the other
               functions.

         • ‘analyse_SAR.TL()’

             • The first object in the returned ‘RLum.Results’ objects
               was renamed to ‘data’ to gain consistency with the other
               functions.

         • ‘analyse_pIRIRSequence()’

             • The first object in the returned ‘RLum.Results’ objects
               was renamed to ‘data’ to gain consistency with the other
               functions.

         • ‘calc_FadingCorr()’

             • New argument ‘tc.g_value’ introduced allowing to specify
               the tc value of the g-value.  This might be useful with
               regard to the common normalisation to two days.
               Internally the function re-calculates the g-value to the
               tc of the De measurement.

             • new argument ‘verbose’ introduced,

             • documention and examples extended.

         • ‘plot_AbanicoPlot()’

             • Now returns the ‘par’ settings and a numerical output is
               set to default, this allows to reproduce the plot and
               add further information to it,

             • examples updated.

         • ‘plot_DRT()’

             • Fix statistical summay keyword issue (reported by Alice
               Versendaal),

             • improve customised colouring and pch settings.

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’

             • ‘fit.method’ set to linear for problematic cases (two
               reg points).

         • ‘plot_Histogram()’

             • Fix a problem while dealing with ‘RLum.Results’ objects
               as input (#7, thanks to Alice Versendaal).

         • ‘plot_KDE()’

             • Fix a problem while dealing with ‘RLum.Results’ objects
               as input (#7, thanks to Alice Versendaal),

             • function will not break any longe if only one point is
               provided, but in this case no density curve is returned.
