  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_baSAR()’

             • Fix problem that causes a function crash if an XLS-file
               was provided as input for the grain selection.

         • ‘analyse_pIRIRSequence()’

             • Account for a minor layout problem while plotting the
               combined growth curve (y-axis scaling was not
               sufficient)

         • ‘plot_AbanicoPlot()’

             • The relative and absolute standard deviation were mixed
               up in in the summary; fixed.
