NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.6.1 (July 5th ,2016):

  Bugfixes and changes:

         • ‘analyse_baSAR()’

             • Add ‘n.chains’ option to ‘method_control’,

             • add ‘inits’ to ‘method_control’ to set the RNG,

             • add ‘thin’ to ‘method_control’ to control the
               monitoring,

             • account for probable odd use input if the ‘XLS_file’ is
               a ‘data.frame’ (column 1 is of type ‘factor’ instead
               ‘character’),

             • function will not stop anymore if grain and position
               number do not match,

             • adjust graphical ouptut,

             • add new argument ‘model_baSAR’ for user defined models,

             • a lots of minor improvements.

         • ‘analyse_SAR.CWOSL()’

             • The argument 'sig0' was not passed to
               ‘calc_OSLLxTxRatio()’ as stated in the description of
               the ‘...’ argument. Fixed.

             • Now also works for dose recovery measurement data where
               the dose of the first OSL signal is not zero. Previously
               the function crashed with an arbitrary error.  Now it
               checks if the natural dose is 0, and if not, overwrites
               it whilst warning the user about this.

         • ‘calc_OSLLxTxRatio()’

             • ‘NaN’ values now are automatically changed to 0. With
               regard to the underlying equations this is
               mathematically not correct, as the function returns
               ‘NaN’ in cases where 0 is divided by 0, but ‘NaN’ makes
               no sense for the further data processing and is
               therefore not meaningful,

             • object ‘call’ is moved into the info slot.

         • ‘merge_RisoeBINfileData()’

             • Account for 'implicit list embedding of S4 objects is
               deprecated' warning by changing the code (no visible
               user effect, apart from no visible warning anymore).

         • ‘plot_AbanicoPlot()’

             • Function got a new argument ‘line.lty’ to controll the
               appearance of additional lines.

         • ‘plot_GrowthCurve()’

             • Move ‘call’ output in the ‘RLum.Results’ output element
               ‘list’,

             • if less than 3 regeneration points are provided the
               function will not stop and return ‘NULL’, but set
               ‘fit.method = "LIN"’, return a message and continue.
               With this the user gets at least a plot,

             • allow linear fitting with only 1 dose point if the curve
               is forced through the origin,

             • function now returns values even the error 'figure
               margins too large' shows up.

         • ‘read_BIN2R()’

             • Add suppurt for BIN-file version 8; thanks for the
               support by Kristina Thomsen from Risoe.

         • ‘Risoe.BINfileData-class’

             • Add support for BIN-file version 8.

         • ‘verify_SingleGrainData()’

             • Add argument ‘plot’ to function and with this a
               graphical feedback (default is ‘FALSE’),

             • enhance manual to better describe the applied selection
               method.

         • ‘write_R2BIN()’

             • Add support for BIN-file version 8.

  S3-generics:

         • The method ‘subset’ for ‘RisoeBINfileData’ objects got a new
           argument ‘records.rm’. If set to ‘FALSE’ curves are only
           selected/deselected, but not removed all.

  Internals:

         • Add package ‘coda’ as suggested package.
