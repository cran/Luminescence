NEWS for the R Package Luminescence

Changes in version 0.4.6 (21st September, 2015):

        • This update is fixing only one specific issue that causes a
          warning message on the CRAN servers (and on packages that
          inversely importing this package), due to the way the
          protoype for the ‘RLum.Data.Image’ object was constructed
          ('rgdal' issue).
