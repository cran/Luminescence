\title{
Apply a fading correction according to Huntley & Lamothe (2001) for a given g-value.
}
\description{
This function runs the iterations that are needed to calculate the corrected age including the error 
for a given g-value according to Huntley & Lamothe (2001).
}
\usage{
calc_FadingCorr(g_value, tc, age.faded, n.MCruns = 500)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{g_value}{\link{vector} (\bold{required}): g-value and error obtained from separate 
  fading measurements (see example)
}
  \item{tc}{\link{numeric} (\bold{required}): time in seconds (time between irradiation and
  the prompt measurement, cf. Huntely & Lamothe 2001).
}
  \item{age.faded}{\link{numeric} \link{vector} (\bold{required}): uncorrected age with error in ka (see example)
}

 \item{n.MCruns}{\link{integer} (with default): number of Monte Carlo simulation runs for error estimation
}
}
\details{
The error of the fading-corrected age is determined using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. 
Large values for \code{n.MCruns} will significantly increase the computation time.
}
\value{
A \link{data.frame} containing the fading-corrected age is returned.
