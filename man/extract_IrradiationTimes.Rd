\title{Extract irradiation times from an XSYG file}
\description{Extracts irradiation times, dose and times since last irradiation, from a Freiberg Instruments
XSYG-file. These information can be further used to update an existing BINX-file}
\usage{extract_IrradiationTimes(file.XSYG, file.BINX, recordType = c("irradiation (NA)", 
    "IRSL (UVVIS)", "OSL (UVVIS)", "TL (UVVIS)"), txtProgressBar = TRUE)}
\arguments{
  \item{file.XSYG}{\code{\link{character}} (\bold{required}): path and file name of the XSYG file.}
  \item{file.BINX}{\code{\link{character}} (optional): path and file name of an existing BINX-file. If a file name
is provided the file will be updated with the information from the XSYG file in the same
folder as the original BINX-file.\cr
Note: The XSYG and the BINX-file have to be originate from the same measurement!}
  \item{recordType}{\code{\link{character}} (with default): select relevant curves types from the XSYG file.
As the XSYG-file format comprises much more information than usually needed for routine
data analysis and allowed in the BINX-file format, only the relevant curves are selected
by using the function \code{\link{get_RLum.Analysis}}. The argument
\code{recordType} works as described for this function. \cr

Note: A wrong selection will causes a function error. Please change this argument only
if you have reasons to do so.}
  \item{txtProgressBar}{\code{\link{logical}} (with default): enables \code{TRUE} or disables \code{FALSE}
the progression bars during import and export}
}
\details{The function was written to compensate missing information in the BINX-file output of
Freiberg Instruments lexsyg readers. As all information are available within the XSYG-file anyway,
these information can be extracted and used for further analysis or/and to stored
in a new BINX-file, which can be further used by other software, e.g. Analyst (Geoff Duller). \cr

Typical application example: g-value estimation from fading measurements using the Analyst
or any other self written script.\cr

Beside the some simple data transformation steps the function applies the functions \code{\link{readXSYG2R}},
\code{\link{readBIN2R}}, \code{\link{writeR2BIN}} for data import and export.}
\value{An \code{\linkS4class{RLum.Results}} object is returned with the following structure:\cr
.. $irr.times (data.frame)\cr

If a BINX-file path and name is set, the output will be additionally transferred
to a new BINX-file with the function name as suffix. For the output
the path of the input BINX-file itself is used.}

\note{The produced output object contains still the irradiation steps to keep the output transparent.
However, for the BINX-file export this steps are removed as the BINX-file format description
does not allow irradiations as separat sequences steps.\cr

Know issue: The 'fading correction' menu in the Analyst will not work appear with the produced
BIN/BINX-file due to hidden bits, which are not reproduced by the function \code{writeR2BIN()}.}
